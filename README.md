The original program came from [Joseph Weizenbaum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum) from wayback in the 1960's.

Joseph Weizenbaum's book [Computer Power and Human Reason](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Power-Reason-Penguin-Science/dp/0140179119/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422040551&sr=1-2&keywords=computer+power+and+human+reason) discusses why we should not trust computers due to their inability to show human emotions such as compassion and empathy.
